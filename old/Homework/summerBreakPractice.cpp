/*TODO1: create a compound interest calculator (ask for the initial amount, interest rate, etc)
    TODO2: using a pointer to the output of said compound interest calculator (turn it into an int so we can use it), print a pyramid of #'s (left-leaning) 
        TODO3: (taken from USACO COWsignal)
        Bessie and her cow friends are playing as their favorite cow superheroes. Of course, everyone knows that any self-respecting superhero needs a signal to call them to action. Bessie has drawn a special signal on a sheet of M×N
        paper (1 <= M <= 10,1 <= N <= 10), but this is too small, much too small! 
        Bessie wants to amplify the signal so it is exactly K times bigger (1 ≤ K ≤ 10) in each direction.
        The signal will consist only of the '.' and 'X' characters.


INPUT FORMAT (terminal):
enter length (press enter)
enter height (press enter)
enter scale (press enter)

enter signal with corresponding dimensions and chars [. , X] (press enter)

OUTPUT FORMAT (terminal):
You should output K * M
 lines, each with K * N
 characters, giving a picture of the enlarged signal.
