/*
TODO 1: when asked for a char (single character), the user will input any lowercase alphabetical char, yoou have to find a way to store it without using a char varibale itslef (hint: a-z is the same as 1-26)
TODO 2: (write a function that takes the processed input of TODO 1 and returns a modifed value  ) if the char form TODO 1 is alphabetically greater than F,
divide it by two (you can taker the lower number in int divison). Otherwise, the alphabetically double plus one letter.
TODO 3: populate (fill) an array of the first alphabetical value of TODO 1 (or first processed input) in length. Each element should be a the return of the previous element (unless its the firs one,
then you should use the value from TODO 1)
TODO 4: Find a way to sort this array alphabetically (a-z) [GENERAL HINT: you should only be using numerical variables], print out the Letters in the array with one space between each one.
