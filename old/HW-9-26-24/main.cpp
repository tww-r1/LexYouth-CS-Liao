/*TODO 1:
    given a string via user input, please check if it is a palindrome or if you can write it backwords to get the same word (pretty simple. Then print out if it is one.
  TODO 2:
    create a function, which takes in an input of 3 numbers separated by spaces (this allows cin to discern that they are separate) and outputs the greates of the three
  TODO 3:
    this program should take it 3 numbers and get the greatest one (TODO 2 output. Then the program will print out a strip of #'s the length of the greatest number, switching the positions of the other numbers on the strip with '@'
