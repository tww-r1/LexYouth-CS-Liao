Go through the vector and add 17 * (the value of the element) to said element.
Use the sort() function to sort the vector [v is a placeholder for the vector sort(v.begin(), v.end()) POINTERS :) ]
Now prompt the user for what number to find in the vector and rtell them whether not it is in the vector

Enter a number to check membership of: 421
That is not in the list! // or That is in the list!
